This directory contains local copies of various third-party modules we
need.  They're included here so that a) the end user will not need to
install them and b) natools ends up with a known version of the
modules.

Included are:

    MP3::Info                       (version 1.23)
    Ogg::Vorbis::Header::PurePerl   (version 0.07)
    Class::Std                      (version 0.011)

These are unmodified from the installed CPAN modules but we only
include the actual modules.  The files normally created by Makefile.PL
are not here.

They are copyright (C) their authors and distributed under (at least)
the same terms as natool.
